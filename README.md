# Uml_Diagram_Maker

A new Flutter project.
Purpose of the software is to create a Unified Modeling Language diagram maker and make it easier for users to generate it. The main problem is that it is difficult to convert actors into a UML diagram and it is to perceive the complex data otherwise. This system will use python for an inexpensive solution through machine language, ensuring that data is accurate, and operations are reliable. This system consists of a mobile application and a web application that will perform operations and store data on the cloud.

The project uses Machine Language Algorithms for converting images and texts into UML to provide the best possible outlook to any complex system. Data is also encrypted and stored on the cloud to ensure security and accessibility. This system will also allow software users to store, modify and convert their data into UML.

->	Modules

1.	Profile Management
2.	Auto UML Generator
3.	UML Diagram Identifier
4.	Diagram Editor
5.	Picture To Diagram
6.	Communication

->Advantages/Benefits of Proposed System

•	Auto UML generator will create much ease for the user as it will automatically draw the diagrams according to the requirements. With technologies in hand the complex problems will become easy to solve and take less time.

•	As our software is based on both Web and Mobile application user can easily access his/her work and edit it any time from any platform.

•	Implementing this system will reduce the manpower which will cut down the cost and time to nearly 80 percent, they will not have to hire workers for the drawing and designing of UML diagrams.

•	It will auto identify the UML diagrams and help the user to edit it.

•	Image files or pictures having UML diagram in them can also be converted into UML diagrams and can be further edited.

•	The data on the cloud can be always accessed from any location and through any device with proper authentication. No matter the circumstances the data will not be corrupted.


->	System Limitations/Constraints

•	User must have a reliable internet connection to access online features in order to access previously saved work etc.
•	For the smartphone users, only Android and iOS are supported.
•	The type of diagram and actors required by the user must be present in the software data.
•	For scanning a handmade UML diagram, a camera is required.
•	It should be a pdf or word file from which UML diagrams will be identified.
•	To recognize the pattern, the diagrams must be properly drawn.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
